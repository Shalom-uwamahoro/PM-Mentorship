    <h1>Born A Crime: A Mirror To Gomaâ€™s Story</h1>
    <br>
    <div id="summary">
    <p>"Born a Crime" by Trevor Noah vividly illustrates the harsh realities of growing up in a racially segregated society,
        as seen in the stories shared in its first two chapters. Noah's personal accounts explore the intricacies of identity,
        belonging, and survival, deeply connecting with the struggles experienced in Goma, DRC. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In these initial chapters, Noah battles with the complexities of being the child of a black mother and a white father during apartheid 
        in South Africa, a union that was illegal at the time. This reflects the ethnic diversity and cultural intricacies present in Goma, 
        where multiple languages are spoken and social divisions persist due to historical legacies and ongoing conflicts.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The themes of segregation and discrimination portrayed in Noah's narrative parallel the socio-political landscape of Goma, 
        where political corruption and insecurity worsen existing ethnic tensions. Just as Noah faces the constraints imposed by apartheid laws, 
        individuals in Goma encounter obstacles to communication and social advancement due to systemic inequalities and inadequate infrastructure.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Furthermore, Noah's story highlights the resilience and resourcefulness needed to navigate such oppressive environments, 
        qualities undoubtedly shared by many in Goma. Despite the challenges, both Noah and the individuals in Goma display remarkable 
        adaptability and determination to create a better future for themselves. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Overall, "Born a Crime" provides a moving exploration of the universal
        human experience of overcoming adversity and finding one's place in a divided world, deeply resonating with the difficulties faced in Goma, DRC.
